    "originTitle": "About This Website",
    "originContent": "During my preparation for the 2026 postgraduate entrance exam (in 2025), I stumbled upon some personal blogs, such as <0>Zhilu's Blog</0>. It was beautiful, efficient, and well-written, which I really loved ☺️. Through the friend links, I saw many people recording their lives on their own websites. It reminded me of my own university days and the many things I wanted to share but didn't know where. That's when the idea of creating my own website was planted.",
    "techTitle": "Building Process",
    "techContent": "During the winter break after the exam, I started researching how to build it. I knew about many existing frameworks, but to apply some of the frontend knowledge I had learned before and to learn more through this project, I quickly deployed a prototype. Later, with the help of AI, I quickly built this semi-finished website. If any experts find any bugs or areas for improvement, please point them out!",
    "futureContent": "I will start recording my life and continuously share my experiences and daily routines."
